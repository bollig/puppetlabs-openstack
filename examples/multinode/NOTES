 - glance Auth endpoint is still http
 - heat Auth endpoint is still http

-- How to enable SSL on heat and glance?
-- Is nova SSL? 
-- How to test? 
-> search for http (replace with http_protocol)
-> search for keystone_auth_host and replace with identity_uri and auth_uri/

NOTE: trove images are registered via trove_datastore_version. If a database instance will not boot, it is likely due to either a bad datastore_version image_id, or insufficient resources for the flavor or because of the flavor. To get around the image_id problem: 

1) glance image-list 
2) update common.yaml with the ID values and not NAME values.

LBaaS requires that at least one member of the pool attach to a valid and OPEN port (i.e., enabled in Security Groups). If you try to attach to a closed port you will get this warning on the server: 

Broadcast message from systemd-journald@control (Thu 2016-02-25 22:46:11 UTC):

haproxy[15640]: backend 6df266f2-bdb5-4f83-b18c-6f9aa30c7016 has no server available!

NOTE: you can have 4 valid member->port connections and one bad, and the message will not appear. However, that one bad will never get any traffic.

On atmosphere* (add to puppet): 

# Where 28 is provided by 
# Should be a line that starts with 9999
iptables -L -n --line-numbers | grep REJECT
iptables -D INPUT 28 
iptables -A INPUT -p gre -s 10.31.13.128/26 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT


To enable ping of VMs: 

1) Add static IP to the br-ex (gateway) 
    ip addr add 192.168.22.2/24 dev br-ex
    iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING 1 -s 192.168.22.0/24 -j MASQUERADE

1) Add ICMP ingress to the default security group
    # These rule ids are 'default'
    neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol icmp 2c9fe88a-fd8f-4d05-a5de-e0526232883d
    neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol icmp 12dbf1b0-df16-47a3-a259-89e5db7011ab

2) On control (network node):  
    ip netns exec qrouter-93a78975-02d4-4de3-898d-f9ba16aa18cd ping 10.0.0.4


########

To monitor traffic hitting a node: 
    yum install -y tcpdump 
    tcpdump -i any -n -v \ 'icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echoreply or icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echo'

Pacemaker

Pacemaker can be used for HA distribution of nova services. See modules/nova/examples/*.pp for details. The nova services are not tracked by puppet, allowing pacemaker to launch them as needed across nodes

Live Migration fails due to: 

    InvalidSharedStorage: compute02 is not on shared storage: Live migration can not be used without shared storage except a booted from volume VM which does not have a local disk.

To build from scratch: 

    vagrant sandbox on

    ./00_download_modules.sh
    ./05_up.sh
    ./10_setup_master.sh
    ./11_setup_openstack.sh
    ./20_setup_nodes.sh

    vagrant sandbox commit

    ./30_deploy_control.sh
    ./40_deploy_nodes.sh

If not satisfied you can rollback:

    vagrant sandbox rollback

To test: 

    ./41_setup_tempest.sh
    ./42_run_tempest.sh
    ./50_destroy_nodes.sh

To leave sandbox mod:

    vagrant sandbox off
